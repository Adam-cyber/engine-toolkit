# Exif engine

This sample engine is a fully functional engine that runs on the Veritone platform.

It uses the `github.com/rwcarlsen/goexif` project to extract EXIF metadata from the chunks sent to it.

It is written in Go and makes use of the [Veritone Engine Toolkit](https://machinebox.io/experiments/engine-toolkit).
