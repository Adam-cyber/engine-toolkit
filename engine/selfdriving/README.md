# Self driving engines

- [ ] Walk a directory collecting all files matching pattern
- [ ] Ignore any that are "locked" (`.ready`, `.processing`)
- [ ] Ignore any files 
- [ ] Select file at random
- [ ] Process a file through the engine (each file is a chunk)
- [ ] Save output files to output folder (into time buckets)
